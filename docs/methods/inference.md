# Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI)

> ← [Semi-Supervised](semi_supervised.md) | [Visualization](visualization.md) →

PPI is a statistical framework for performing **valid inference** using a combination of a small set of gold-standard labels and a large set of machine learning predictions.  It produces confidence intervals that are (1) **narrower** than using gold labels alone and (2) **statistically valid** even if the ML model is arbitrarily biased.

!!! abstract "Why this matters"
    In many domains — healthcare, remote sensing, social science, NLP evaluation — obtaining accurate labels is expensive, but cheap ML predictions are abundant.  PPI lets you exploit this asymmetry for rigorous statistical analysis.

## Background and Motivation

### The Problem

Suppose you want to estimate a population parameter $\theta$ (a mean, a quantile, or a regression coefficient).  You have two data sources:

| Source | Size | Quality | Cost |
|:-------|:----:|:--------|:-----|
| **Gold-standard labels** $Y_i$ | $n$ (small) | Accurate | Expensive (expert annotation, spectroscopy, laboratory assay) |
| **ML predictions** $\hat{f}(X_i)$ | $N \gg n$ (large) | Potentially biased | Cheap (automated model) |

Three naive approaches all have critical flaws:

| Approach | Problem |
|:---------|:--------|
| Use only gold labels | Valid but **imprecise** — CIs are wide because $n$ is small |
| Use only predictions | **Invalid** — systematic model bias contaminates the estimate |
| Mix them ad hoc | No coverage guarantee — unclear how to combine |

### The PPI Solution

PPI uses the large prediction set for **precision** and the small gold set for **bias correction**.  The **rectified estimator** is:

$$\boxed{\;\hat\theta_{\text{PPI}} = \underbrace{\hat\theta_N(\hat{f})}_{\substack{\text{prediction}\\\text{on all } N}} \;-\; \underbrace{\bigl(\hat\theta_n(\hat{f}) - \hat\theta_n(Y)\bigr)}_{\substack{\text{bias correction}\\\text{on labelled }n}}\;}$$

The first term uses all $N$ samples for precision.  The bias correction (middle two terms) cancels the model's systematic error, estimated on the labelled subset.

!!! success "Validity guarantee"
    The resulting CIs are valid **regardless of model quality**.  If the model is accurate ($R^2 \approx 1$), CIs are much tighter.  If the model is poor ($R^2 \approx 0$), PPI gracefully degrades to gold-label-only inference, never making things worse (PPI++).

## Core Assumptions

PPI's validity rests on a small number of assumptions:

| Assumption | Description | Diagnostic |
|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|
| **Exchangeability** | Labelled and unlabelled samples drawn from the **same population** (MCAR) | Compare covariate distributions |
| **External model** | The prediction model $\hat{f}$ must be trained on **data separate from** the internal dataset | Prevents overfitting bias |
| **Full covariates** | All features needed by $\hat{f}$ are observed for **every unit** (labelled and unlabelled) | Check for missingness |

!!! warning "When PPI breaks"
    If labelling is **not random** (e.g., only easy-to-classify examples get labels), the bias correction is invalid.  This is the Missing Not At Random (MNAR) setting; extensions exist but require additional modelling \[5\].

## Available Estimators

| Function | Estimand | Typical Application |
|:---------|:---------|:-------------------|
| `ppi_mean_ci` | Population mean $\mathbb{E}[Y]$ | Average treatment effect, prevalence estimation |
| `ppi_calibrated_mean_ci` | Same, with affine post-hoc calibration of the score | Mis-scaled but informative scores (OLS on labeled pairs) |
| `ppi_quantile_ci` | Population quantile $Q_\tau$ | Median income, tail risk |
| `ppi_ols_ci` | OLS coefficients $\beta$ | Regression with proxy labels |
| `ppi_diagnostics` | — | Prediction quality assessment |

### Population Mean

```python
from torchregress.inference import PPIConfig, ppi_mean_ci

ci = ppi_mean_ci(
    y_labeled=y_gold,
    pred_labeled=f_hat_gold,
    pred_unlabeled=f_hat_all,
    config=PPIConfig(alpha=0.05),
)
print(f"95% CI: [{ci['ci_lower']:.4f}, {ci['ci_upper']:.4f}]")
```

### Population Quantile

```python
from torchregress.inference import PPIConfig, ppi_quantile_ci

ci = ppi_quantile_ci(
    y_labeled=y_gold,
    pred_labeled=f_hat_gold,
    pred_unlabeled=f_hat_all,
    q=0.5,  # median
    config=PPIConfig(alpha=0.05),
)
```

The quantile estimator inverts the **rectified CDF**
$\hat F(\theta) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_j 1\{\tilde f_j \le \theta\} + \frac{1}{n}\sum_i \big(1\{Y_i \le \theta\} - 1\{f_i \le \theta\}\big)$:
the estimate is $\inf\{\theta : \hat F(\theta) \ge q\}$ and the CI collects the $\theta$ whose
$|\hat F(\theta) - q|$ is within $z_{1-\alpha/2}$ standard errors \[1\]. The
interval is analytic, so `n_boot` and `seed` are not used.

### OLS Coefficients

```python
from torchregress.inference import PPIConfig, ppi_ols_ci

ci = ppi_ols_ci(
    x_labeled=x_gold, y_labeled=y_gold,
    x_unlabeled=x_all, pred_labeled=f_hat_gold, pred_unlabeled=f_hat_all,
    config=PPIConfig(alpha=0.05),
)
```

### Calibrated PPI for the mean

Chen et al. (*Calibeating Prediction-Powered Inference*, [arXiv:2604.21260](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.21260)) study **post-hoc calibration** of a fixed scalar score $m(X)$ on the labeled sample before semisupervised mean estimation.  Torchregress implements their **linearly calibrated** mean (Section 3.3): fit an affine map by ordinary least squares on labeled pairs,

$$
m_n^\star(x) := \hat a + \hat b\, m(x), \qquad (\hat a, \hat b) \in \arg\min_{a,b \in \mathbb{R}} \;\sum_{i=1}^n \{Y_i - a - b\, m(X_i)\}^2.
$$

Then apply the **same rectified mean** as `ppi_mean_ci`, but with $m_n^\star$ in place of $m$:

$$
\hat\psi = \underbrace{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N m_n^\star(\tilde X_j)}_{\text{unlabeled plug-in}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \bigl(Y_i - m_n^\star(X_i)\bigr)}_{\text{labeled residual}}.
$$

Bootstrap percentile intervals **refit** $(\hat a, \hat b)$ on each labeled bootstrap replicate (and draw independent unlabeled bootstrap rows), which accounts for calibration uncertainty.  The paper also analyzes isotonic calibration theoretically; we omit it here in favor of the lightweight affine map (pure PyTorch), which they relate to prognostic-score style adjustment and to PPI++ at first order.

```python
from torchregress.inference import PPIConfig, ppi_calibrated_mean_ci

ci_cal = ppi_calibrated_mean_ci(
    y_labeled=y_gold,
    pred_labeled=f_hat_gold,
    pred_unlabeled=f_hat_all,
    config=PPIConfig(alpha=0.05, n_boot=2000, seed=0),
)
```

!!! tip "When this helps"
    Use calibrated PPI when the score tracks $Y$ but has the **wrong slope or intercept** (common for models trained on another population or loss).  If the score is already conditionally unbiased, gains over `ppi_mean_ci` may be modest.

## Inference vs prediction (and “better on all metrics”)

Earlier guidance distinguished two kinds of follow-up work:

| Track | What it meant | Role |
|:------|:--------------|:-----|
| **(b) Code** | Wire **existing** pieces together (e.g. `SplitConformal` + PPI) in a runnable workflow | Shows a **defensible pipeline**, not a single magic estimator |
| **(c) Docs** | Explain **which metric** each method optimizes and where tradeoffs live | Sets expectations so “better everywhere” is not promised |

**There is no single procedure that simultaneously maximizes every metric** (interval width vs coverage vs bias vs sharpness vs conditional validity).  What you *can* do is **separate estimands** and use the right tool per question:

| Goal | Typical tool in torchregress | Contract (informal) |
|:-----|:----------------------------|:--------------------|
| **Uncertainty for a summary** (e.g. $\mathbb{E}[Y]$, OLS $\beta$) | `ppi_mean_ci`, `ppi_calibrated_mean_ci`, `ppi_ols_ci`, … | Uses labeled + unlabeled; **bias-aware** rectification |
| **Finite-sample predictive bands** for individual $Y$ | `torchregress.losses.SplitConformal`, CQR, … | **Exchangeability / split** assumptions; calibrate scores on a **held-out** labeled fold |

**Conformalizing** in the strict sense means building **nonconformity scores** on labeled data and extrapolating intervals to new predictions — it does **not** replace PPI’s job for $\mathbb{E}[Y]$, but it **complements** it when you also care about **per-unit** coverage.

### Recommended composition

1. **Split the labeled data** (at least two folds): one fold fits **affine calibration** (or any post-hoc map), another supports **PPI** bias correction together with unlabeled scores, and optionally a third (or reuse a fold carefully) feeds **split conformal** calibration.
2. Use **`ppi_calibrated_mean_ci`** when you are comfortable refitting $(\hat a,\hat b)$ on every labeled bootstrap replicate (often good variance when $n$ is not tiny).
3. Use **`SplitConformal`** on **residuals** $|Y - \hat Y|$ where $\hat Y$ is the **same** post-calibrated score you will deploy at test time, calibrated only on data **not** used to cherry-pick that map if you need clean marginal guarantees.

A minimal end-to-end sketch is in [`examples/ppi_mean_plus_split_conformal.py`](https://github.com/astroai/torchregress/blob/main/examples/ppi_mean_plus_split_conformal.py).

## Efficiency and When to Expect Gains

The precision gain from PPI depends on the **predictive quality** of the model:

$$\text{Variance ratio} \approx \frac{1}{1 - R^2}$$

| Model quality | $R^2$ | Effective sample size multiplier | CI width reduction |
|:-------------|:-----:|:-------------------------------:|:-----------------:|
| Excellent | 0.95 | $\sim 20\times$ | $\sim 78\%$ |
| Good | 0.80 | $\sim 5\times$ | $\sim 55\%$ |
| Moderate | 0.50 | $\sim 2\times$ | $\sim 30\%$ |
| Poor | 0.10 | $\sim 1.1\times$ | $\sim 5\%$ |
| Useless | 0.00 | $1\times$ (no gain) | $0\%$ |

!!! tip "Rule of thumb"
    PPI is most valuable when $R^2 > 0.5$ and $N/n > 10$.  Use `ppi_diagnostics` to assess before committing.

# ML predictions on gold set (correlated but biased)
f_hat_gold = y_gold + 1.5 + 0.8 * torch.randn(150)  # bias = +1.5 days

# ML predictions on full population
f_hat_all = 15.5 + 3.0 * torch.randn(10_000)

# --- Gold-only CI (wide) ---
gold_mean = y_gold.mean()
gold_se = y_gold.std() / (150 ** 0.5)
print(f"Gold-only 95% CI: [{gold_mean - 1.96*gold_se:.2f}, {gold_mean + 1.96*gold_se:.2f}]")
print(f"  Width: {2 * 1.96 * gold_se:.2f} days")

# --- PPI CI (narrower) ---
from torchregress.inference import PPIConfig
ci = ppi_mean_ci(y_gold, f_hat_gold, f_hat_all, config=PPIConfig(alpha=0.05))
print(f"PPI      95% CI: [{ci['ci_lower']:.2f}, {ci['ci_upper']:.2f}]")
print(f"  Width: {ci['ci_upper'] - ci['ci_lower']:.2f} days")

# Diagnostics
diag = ppi_diagnostics(y_gold, f_hat_gold, f_hat_all)
```

## Strengths and Limitations

!!! success "Strengths"
    - **Model-agnostic** — valid even when $\hat{f}$ is arbitrarily wrong
    - **Never hurts** (PPI++) — asymptotically never increases variance over gold-only
    - **Modular** — works for means, quantiles, regression, classification
    - **Broad applicability** — biomedicine, remote sensing, social science, NLP

!!! warning "Limitations"
    - Requires **MCAR labelling** — if labels are obtained non-randomly, extensions are needed
    - No gain when predictions are **uninformative** ($R^2 \approx 0$)
    - Model must be trained on **external data** (not the same dataset)
    - The proliferation of PPI variants (PPI, PPI++, Cross-PPI, Cross-PPBoot) creates a usability gap \[5\]

## Limitations

1. **MCAR labelling required**: PPI assumes labelled samples are Missing Completely At Random. If labelling is non-random (e.g., only easy examples get labels), the bias correction is invalid. Extensions for MNAR exist but require additional modelling.
2. **No gain with uninformative predictions**: If the ML model has $R^2 \approx 0$, PPI provides no precision gain over gold-only inference. Use `ppi_diagnostics` to assess predictive quality before committing.
3. **External model requirement**: The prediction model must be trained on data separate from the internal dataset used for inference. Training and evaluating on the same data introduces overfitting bias that invalidates confidence intervals.
4. **Bootstrap cost**: Bootstrap-based CIs (`ppi_calibrated_mean_ci`, PPI++) refit nuisance parameters on each bootstrap replicate. For large $n$ or many bootstraps, this adds non-trivial runtime.
5. **Not a drop-in replacement for conformal prediction**: PPI targets population-level estimands (means, quantiles, regression coefficients). For per-unit prediction intervals, use the [Conformal prediction](conformal/index.md) tools.

## Recommendations

- **Check $R^2$ first**: PPI is most valuable when $R^2 > 0.5$ and $N/n > 10$. Run `ppi_diagnostics` to estimate the expected CI width reduction before investing in a full PPI pipeline.
- **Use `ppi_calibrated_mean_ci` for mismatched scores**: When the ML score tracks $Y$ but has the wrong slope or intercept (common for models trained on a different population or loss function), calibrated PPI often improves over plain `ppi_mean_ci`.
- **Split your data carefully**: Hold out one fold for affine calibration, another for PPI bias correction, and optionally a third for split-conformal calibration. Never reuse the same fold for multiple stages.
- **Complement with conformal prediction**: Use PPI for population-level inference (e.g., "what is the mean recovery time?") and SplitConformal for per-unit prediction intervals ("what is the recovery time for this patient?"). See [`examples/ppi_mean_plus_split_conformal.py`](../../examples/ppi_mean_plus_split_conformal.py).
- **Degrade gracefully with PPI++**: When model quality is uncertain, use PPI++ (via `power=1.0`) — it asymptotically never increases variance over gold-only inference.
