# SIMEX (Simulation Extrapolation)

> ← [IRLS](irls.md) | [RC](rc.md) →

SIMEX is a simulation-based method for correcting **measurement error in inputs**.  Unlike [RC](rc.md) which analytically debiases, SIMEX works by **adding** progressively more noise then **extrapolating back** to zero noise.

!!! abstract "The idea"
    1. Simulate additional noise at increasing levels $\lambda$
    2. Train a separate model at each noise level
    3. Fit a polynomial through predictions vs. $\lambda$
    4. Extrapolate to $\lambda = -1$ (hypothetical zero-error case)

## Mathematical Background

### Adding Simulated Noise

Given observed data with measurement error covariance $\Sigma_u$, SIMEX adds **additional** simulated noise:

$$W_\lambda = W + \sqrt{\lambda}\,U', \qquad U' \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\, \Sigma_u)$$

At level $\lambda$, the total measurement error variance is $(1 + \lambda)\,\Sigma_u$.

### Extrapolation to $\lambda = -1$

The key insight: at $\lambda = -1$, the total noise variance would be:

$$(1 + (-1))\,\Sigma_u = \mathbf{0}$$

SIMEX fits a **polynomial** through predictions at $\lambda \in \{0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0\}$ and extrapolates:

$$\boxed{\;\hat{f}_{\text{SIMEX}}(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{p} \hat\beta_j \cdot (-1)^j\;}$$

where $\hat\beta_j$ are polynomial coefficients from fitting predictions vs. $\lambda$.

!!! warning "Extrapolation Assumptions & Risks"
    SIMEX extrapolation relies on several assumptions:

    - **Polynomial Smoothness**: SIMEX assumes that the model parameters (or predictions) behave as a smooth, continuous function of the noise level $\lambda$ in the range $[-1, \lambda_{\max}]$, which can be well-approximated by a low-order (linear or quadratic) polynomial.
    - **Divergence Risk**: If the true relationship has high curvature or a singularity near $\lambda = -1$ (i.e. zero measurement error), polynomial fitting can lead to wild extrapolation errors. Higher-order polynomials ($p \geq 3$) are extremely sensitive to simulation noise and prone to overfitting/divergence (Runge's phenomenon).
    - **Covariance Specification**: SIMEX relies heavily on an accurately estimated measurement error covariance $\Sigma_u$. Over- or under-specifying $\Sigma_u$ directly biases the extrapolated values.
    - **Computational Cost**: SIMEX trains $|\text{lambdas}| + 1$ complete models (one baseline at $\lambda = 0$, plus one for each $\lambda$ value). For deep networks, this multiplies training cost by the number of noise levels.
    - **Negative Variance Artifacts**: When extrapolating polynomial fits to $\lambda = -1$, predicted variance estimates can become negative. Always clamp variance outputs to a minimum positive value after SIMEX correction.

## Usage

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchregress.algorithms import SIMEX

# Model factory — returns a fresh model for each noise level
def model_factory():
    return nn.Sequential(
        nn.Linear(5, 32), nn.ReLU(),
        nn.Linear(32, 1),
    )

# Training function
def train_func(model, X, y):
    opt = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
    for _ in range(200):
        loss = nn.functional.mse_loss(model(X), y)
        opt.zero_grad(); loss.backward(); opt.step()
    return model

# Create SIMEX corrector
simex = SIMEX(
    model_factory=model_factory,
    train_func=train_func,
    sigma_u=0.5,
    lambdas=[0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0],
    extrapolation_order=2,   # quadratic
)

# Fit trains M+1 models internally
simex.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict with measurement-error correction
y_pred = simex.predict(X_test)
```

`predict` perturbs the test inputs with $\sqrt{\lambda}\,\mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma_u)$ noise at every level, drawing an **independent** remeasurement for each of the `n_simulations` models, so the $\lambda$-level prediction averages over all replicates; its Monte Carlo spread shrinks like $1/\sqrt{B}$. The noise is simulated in the dtype of `X_train` (float64 data is supported) and without any absolute jitter, so SIMEX is equivariant to the units of the inputs.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|:----------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `model_factory` | callable | — | Returns a fresh model instance |
| `train_func` | callable | — | `(model, X, y) → trained_model` |
| `sigma_u` | float / Tensor | — | Measurement error (scalar, vector, or cov matrix) |
| `lambdas` | list of float | `[0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]` | Noise multiplier levels |
| `n_simulations` | int | `5` | Monte Carlo replicates averaged per $\lambda$ |
| `extrapolation_order` | int | `2` | Polynomial degree ($1$ = linear, $2$ = quadratic) |

## RC vs SIMEX

| | Regression Calibration | SIMEX |
|:-|:----------------------|:------|
| **Approach** | Analytical debiasing | Simulation + extrapolation |
| **Model assumptions** | Gaussian noise + linear correction | **Any** model, any loss |
| **Compute cost** | Very low (matrix ops) | High ($M$ model trainings) |
| **Flexibility** | Limited to linear effect | Handles **nonlinear** models |
| **Best for** | Quick correction, linear models | Neural nets, complex models |

## When to Use

!!! tip "Good fit for SIMEX"
    - Known measurement uncertainties on inputs
    - Model is **nonlinear** (neural network, tree ensemble)
    - RC's linear correction is **insufficient**

!!! warning "Computational cost"
    SIMEX trains $\lvert\text{lambdas}\rvert + 1$ complete models.  For large networks, consider BatchEnsemble-style weight sharing or use RC as a first approximation.

## Limitations

1. **Extrapolation risk**: SIMEX fits a polynomial through predictions at $\lambda \ge 0$ and extrapolates to $\lambda = -1$. If the true mapping is not well-approximated by a low-order polynomial, extrapolation errors can be severe (Runge's phenomenon). Higher-order polynomials ($p \ge 3$) amplify this risk.
2. **Computational cost**: SIMEX trains $|\text{lambdas}| + 1$ complete models. For deep networks with 4–5 noise levels, this multiplies training cost by 5–6×.
3. **Negative variance artefacts**: Extrapolating polynomial fits to $\lambda = -1$ can produce negative predicted variances. Always clamp variance outputs to a minimum positive value after SIMEX correction.
4. **Known $\Sigma_u$ required**: SIMEX requires an accurately specified measurement error covariance. Over- or under-specifying $\Sigma_u$ directly biases the extrapolated estimates.
5. **Homoscedastic noise assumption**: SIMEX assumes a single $\Sigma_u$ for all samples. Heteroscedastic measurement error (different noise per sample) is not supported.

## Recommendations

- **Default**: Start with `extrapolation_order=2` (quadratic) and `lambdas=[0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]`. Linear extrapolation is safer but less flexible; quadratic is a good compromise.
- **For linear models**: Use [RC](rc.md) instead — it is analytical, instantaneous, and makes the same assumptions without the computational cost.
- **For neural networks with large datasets**: Consider [EIV losses](../../losses/eiv.md) (LatentMarginalizationLoss) which handle measurement error at the loss level without retraining M models.
- **Validate extrapolation**: Plot the SIMEX extrapolation curve with [`plot_simex_extrapolation`](../../api/viz.md) to visually check polynomial fit quality before trusting the correction.

## Next steps

- [Regression Calibration](rc.md) — faster analytical alternative when a linear correction suffices
- [LatentNN](latentnn.md) — single-training-run joint optimisation for noisy inputs, no multi-model overhead
- [Error-Aware Encoding](error_aware.md) — lightweight quality-signal engineering for known input noise
- [EIV losses](../../losses/eiv.md) — loss-level handling of measurement error without retraining
