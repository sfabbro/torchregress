## Member-based ensembles (`BaseEnsembleModel`)

!!! abstract "Summary"
    Shared base for member-based ensembles: builds `ensemble_size` copies of a base module, runs them in parallel, and stacks outputs.

```python
from torchregress.ensemble import BaseEnsembleModel

# Subclasses (HeteroscedasticEnsembleModel, …) wrap this pattern.
```

→ Full API: [BaseEnsembleModel](../../api/ensemble.md).

## Deep ensembles (`BaseEnsembleModel`)

!!! abstract "Summary"
    Train $M$ **independently initialised** copies of a base model.
    Epistemic uncertainty = variance of member predictions.

```python
from torchregress.ensemble import BaseEnsembleModel

ensemble = BaseEnsembleModel(base_model=MyModel, ensemble_size=5, base_seed=0)

# Train each member independently (or train ensemble.models yourself)
ensemble.fit(train_loader, loss_fn, epochs=20, lr=1e-3)

# Predict (members run in eval mode; previous train/eval modes are restored)
result = ensemble.predict(x_test)
mean, epi = result["mean"], result["variance"]   # ensemble mean, epistemic variance

# Raw member outputs: forward returns an already-stacked tensor [M, batch, ...]
preds = ensemble.forward(x_test)
mean = preds.mean(dim=0)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|:----------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `base_model` | `type` or `nn.Module` | — | Model class or instance to ensemble |
| `ensemble_size` | `int` | 5 | Number of independent members |
| `device` | `str` | `"cpu"` | Target device |
| `member_factory` | `callable` or `None` | `None` | `factory(index, seed) -> nn.Module` building each member |
| `base_seed` | `int` or `None` | `None` | Member `i` is initialised with seed `base_seed + i` inside a forked RNG, so the global torch RNG state is not changed |

!!! tip "When to use"
    Use when your base model outputs **only point predictions** ($\hat{y}$) and you want epistemic uncertainty via disagreement.  For **aleatoric + epistemic**, use `HeteroscedasticEnsembleModel`.

!!! note "Adversarial training"
    The original deep-ensemble recipe (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) adds an optional adversarial loss term on FGSM-style perturbed inputs. `BaseEnsembleModel.fit(...)` does **not** implement it; to use it, train `ensemble.models` with your own loop that adds the adversarial term.

!!! note "Eval mode at prediction time"
    `predict(...)` / `predict_full_covariance(...)` run every member in eval mode (dropout off, BatchNorm running statistics used and not updated), then restore each submodule's previous mode. For MC-dropout style sampling, use `MCDropoutWrapper`.

---

## HeteroscedasticEnsembleModel

!!! abstract "Summary"
    Each member predicts $(\mu, \log\sigma^2)$ — enabling full **aleatoric + epistemic** decomposition.

```python
from torchregress.ensemble import HeteroscedasticEnsembleModel

ensemble = HeteroscedasticEnsembleModel(
    base_model=HeteroModel,  # outputs [mean, log_var]
    ensemble_size=5,
)

# After training:
result = ensemble.predict(x_test)
```

Member log-variances are converted with the same bounds `GaussianNLLLoss` trains with
(`log_var` clamped to `[log(1e-6), 30]`), so the reported aleatoric variance matches what
each member learned.

**`predict(x)` output:**

| Key | Shape | Description |
|:----|:------|:------------|
| `"mean"` | $(n, d)$ | $\bar\mu = \frac{1}{M}\sum_m \mu_m$ |
| `"variance"` | $(n, d)$ | Total = aleatoric + epistemic |
| `"aleatoric_variance"` | $(n, d)$ | $\frac{1}{M}\sum_m \sigma_m^2$ |
| `"epistemic_variance"` | $(n, d)$ | $\frac{1}{M}\sum_m (\mu_m - \bar\mu)^2$ |

## HeteroscedasticBatchEnsembleModel

!!! abstract "Summary"
    Memory-efficient ensemble via **rank-1 perturbations** of shared weights.
    Each member applies $W_m = W \circ (r_m\, s_m^\top)$ where $r_m, s_m$ are per-member vectors.

```python
from torchregress.ensemble import HeteroscedasticBatchEnsembleModel

backbone = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(10, 64), nn.ReLU())
backbone.feature_dim = 64  # required: width of the backbone output
batch_ens = HeteroscedasticBatchEnsembleModel(
    backbone=backbone,
    output_size=1,    # target dim d; the head emits mean + log_var (2 * d)
    ensemble_size=4,
)
result = batch_ens.predict(x_test)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|:----------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `backbone` | `nn.Module` | — | Shared feature extractor; must expose `feature_dim` |
| `output_size` | `int` | — | Target dim $d$ (the head outputs $2 \times d$: mean + logvar) |
| `ensemble_size` | `int` | 4 | Number of virtual members |
| `device` | `str` | `"cpu"` | Target device |

!!! tip "When to use"
    When compute or memory budget prohibits $M$ full models.  BatchEnsemble achieves ~80 % of full-ensemble uncertainty quality at ~20 % extra cost.

!!! warning "Member diversity limitation"
    Because BatchEnsemble members share the same base weights $W$ and differ only through rank-1 perturbations, member diversity is inherently lower than in a `BaseEnsembleModel` with independently trained members. For tasks where epistemic uncertainty requires exploring truly disjoint modes in the loss landscape, `BaseEnsembleModel` is preferred despite the higher cost.

## BatchEnsembleLinear

!!! abstract "Summary"
    Rank-1 **BatchEnsemble** perturbation of a linear layer: shared weight $W$ plus per-member vectors $r_m, s_m$ so each virtual member uses an effective weight $W \circ (r_m s_m^\top)$ (see Wen et al., 2020).

```python
from torchregress.ensemble import BatchEnsembleLinear

layer = BatchEnsembleLinear(in_features=10, out_features=64, ensemble_size=4)
```

→ API: [BatchEnsembleLinear](../../api/ensemble.md).

---

## BatchEnsembleMLPBackbone

!!! abstract "Summary"
    Shared-backbone MLP that applies **BatchEnsemble** perturbations through the hidden stack (not only the readout). Suited to tabular-style deep models and efficient ensemble backbones.

```python
from torchregress.ensemble import BatchEnsembleMLPBackbone

backbone = BatchEnsembleMLPBackbone(
    input_size=20,
    hidden_size=128,
    ensemble_size=4,
    hidden_dims=(128, 64),
)
features = backbone(x)  # (batch, ensemble_size, feature_dim)
```

→ API: [BatchEnsembleMLPBackbone](../../api/ensemble.md).

## BinnedPDFEnsembleModel

!!! abstract "Summary"
    Average member predictions in **probability space** for discrete PDFs or regression-as-classification heads.

```python
from torchregress.ensemble import BinnedPDFEnsembleModel

ensemble = BinnedPDFEnsembleModel(
    base_model=MyBinLogitModel,
    ensemble_size=5,
    support_values=torch.linspace(0.0, 4.0, 64),
)
result = ensemble.predict(x_test)
# result: {"probabilities", "log_probabilities", "mean", "variance"}
```

!!! tip "When to use"
    Prefer this over averaging logits when each member predicts a **binned predictive PDF**.  The ensemble should average the predictive distribution, not the pre-softmax parameters.

---

## RandomPartitionEnsembleModel

!!! abstract "Summary"
    Each member predicts a softmax PDF on **its own bin edges**. The ensemble averages **CDFs** mapped to a common evaluation grid, then differencing yields a coherent aggregate PDF (avoids averaging incompatible logits).

```python
from torchregress.ensemble import RandomPartitionEnsembleModel

member_edges = [torch.linspace(0.0, 1.0, 33) for _ in range(5)]
ensemble = RandomPartitionEnsembleModel(
    base_model=MyPartitionHead,
    ensemble_size=5,
    member_bin_edges=member_edges,
)
result = ensemble.predict(x_test)
# result: "probabilities", "cdf_at_edges", "bin_edges", "mean", "variance", ...
```

→ API: [RandomPartitionEnsembleModel](../../api/ensemble.md).

---

## CumulativeLinkEnsembleModel

!!! abstract "Summary"
    Average **ordinal CDF / PMF predictions** across members for cumulative-link heads.

```python
from torchregress.ensemble import CumulativeLinkEnsembleModel

ensemble = CumulativeLinkEnsembleModel(
    base_model=MyOrdinalModel,
    ensemble_size=5,
    support_values=torch.arange(64, dtype=torch.float32),
)
result = ensemble.predict(x_test)
```

!!! tip "When to use"
    Use when the model predicts ordered thresholds / cumulative logits and you want ensemble averaging in the implied probability space rather than averaging thresholds directly.

---

## MDNEnsembleModel

!!! abstract "Summary"
    Ensemble an MDN by forming a **mixture of mixtures**, not by naively averaging component parameters.

```python
from torchregress.ensemble import MDNEnsembleModel

ensemble = MDNEnsembleModel(
    base_model=MyMDNModel,
    ensemble_size=5,
    n_components=4,
    n_features=1,
)
result = ensemble.predict(x_test)
# result: {"mixture_weights", "component_means", "component_stds", "mean", "variance"}
```

!!! warning "Do not average MDN weights component-wise"
    Component 1 in member A is not generally the same mode as component 1 in member B. `MDNEnsembleModel` avoids this label-switching problem by concatenating all member components with a `1 / M` weight factor.

!!! warning "MDNEnsemble memory scaling"
    `MDNEnsembleModel` creates a mixture with $K \cdot M$ components (where $K$ is per-member components and $M$ is ensemble size). Inference methods (`sample`, `predict_interval`) that evaluate all components scale as $\mathcal{O}(K \cdot M)$. For large ensembles with many components, memory usage during MC sampling can become prohibitive.

## SWAG / MultiSWAG

!!! abstract "Summary"
    **S**tochastic **W**eight **A**veraging — **G**aussian.
    Fits a Gaussian over the SGD **weight trajectory**, then samples weight configurations for MC prediction.

=== "SWAG (single)"

    ```python
    from torchregress.ensemble import SWAG

    swag = SWAG(base_model, max_num_models=20)

    # During training — periodically collect snapshots:
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        train_one_epoch(model, ...)
        if epoch >= swa_start:
            swag.collect_model(model)

    # At inference — sample weight configurations and forward:
    predictions = []
    for _ in range(30):
        swag.sample(scale=0.5)
        with torch.no_grad():
            predictions.append(swag(x_test))
    mean = torch.stack(predictions).mean(0)
    var  = torch.stack(predictions).var(0)
    ```

=== "MultiSWAG"

    ```python
    from torchregress.ensemble import MultiSWAG

    # Multiple independent SWAG models for better diversity
    multi_swag = MultiSWAG(base_model, n_models=3, max_num_models=20)
    ```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|:----------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `max_num_models` | `int` | 20 | Max snapshots for low-rank covariance |
| `n_samples` | `int` | 30 | MC forward passes at inference (user loop) |

!!! warning "Sampling & Mode Limits"
    SWAG requires drawing $S$ weight samples and running $S$ forward passes during inference, which increases test latency. It also only approximates the local weight basin mode. For details, see the [Ensemble Limitations Overview](index.md#bayesian-sampling-variational-limitations).

---

## MC-Dropout

!!! abstract "Summary"
    Keep dropout **active** during inference and aggregate multiple stochastic forward passes.

=== "MCDropoutWrapper"

    ```python
    from torchregress.ensemble import MCDropoutWrapper

    mc = MCDropoutWrapper(model, n_samples=20)
    mean, std = mc.predict_with_uncertainty(x_test)
    ```

=== "enable_dropout utility"

    ```python
    from torchregress.ensemble import enable_dropout

    model.eval()
    enable_dropout(model)  # keeps dropout active in eval mode
    ```

!!! quote "Reference"
    Y. Gal, Z. Ghahramani. "Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation." *ICML*, **2016**.

---

## Bayesian Neural Networks

!!! abstract "Summary"
    Replace `nn.Linear` with `VariationalLinear` — weights are sampled from a learned posterior $q(\mathbf{w}) = \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol\mu, \boldsymbol\sigma^2)$ during each forward pass.

=== "VariationalLinear"

    ```python
    from torchregress.ensemble import VariationalLinear

    layer = VariationalLinear(in_features=64, out_features=32)
    # Each forward pass samples weights from N(μ, σ²)
    ```

=== "BayesianNeuralNetwork"

    ```python
    from torchregress.ensemble import BayesianNeuralNetwork

    bnn = BayesianNeuralNetwork(input_dim=10, hidden_dims=[64, 32], output_dim=1, n_samples=10)
    # Training loss includes KL divergence term:
    # L_total = E_q[NLL] + KL(q || p) / n_train
    mean, std = bnn.predict_with_uncertainty(x_test)
    ```

=== "HeteroscedasticBNN"

    ```python
    from torchregress.ensemble import HeteroscedasticBNN

    hbnn = HeteroscedasticBNN(input_dim=10, hidden_dims=[64, 32], output_dim=1, n_samples=10)
    mean, aleatoric, epistemic = hbnn.predict_with_decomposition(x_test)
    ```

!!! warning "Mean-Field & Optimization Sensitivity"
    Standard variational inference models weight parameters with diagonal (mean-field) Gaussian distributions, ignoring correlation structures between parameters. This typically results in **underestimation** of epistemic uncertainty. Optimization is also highly sensitive to the scale parameter $\beta$ of the KL loss term. For details, see the [Ensemble Limitations Overview](index.md#bayesian-sampling-variational-limitations).

combiner = SoftmaxModelCombiner(list(ensemble.models))
combined = combiner(x_test)
mean, variance = combiner.predict_with_uncertainty(x_test)
```

### StackingEnsemble

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from torchregress.ensemble import StackingEnsemble

stacker = StackingEnsemble(list(ensemble.models), meta_learner=nn.Linear(5, 1))
combined = stacker(x_test)
```
