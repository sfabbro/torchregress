Conformal prediction for regression.

Provides standalone conformal predictors (calibration + prediction) and
backward-compatible loss wrappers. Most methods provide finite-sample
marginal coverage guarantees ``>= 1-alpha`` under exchangeability
(split/CQR/CTI/etc.). Cross-validation variants (CV+/Jackknife+) provide
``>= 1-2alpha`` (Barber et al. 2021, Thm 1); weighted variants provide
``>= 1-alpha - 2*Delta`` where ``Delta`` is the total-variation gap to
uniform (Barber et al. 2023).
----------
- SplitConformal: absolute residual scores, ŷ ± q_hat
- CQR: conformalized quantile regression
- UACQR: CQR with scores normalized by predicted quantile band width (thin wrapper)
- CTI: conformal thresholded intervals (density-level sets, smallest intervals)
- DistributionalConformal: PIT-based approximate conditional coverage
- R2CConformal: regression-as-classification for multimodal targets
- MultiTargetConformal: per-dimension calibration for multi-output
- DensityConformal: density-adaptive split conformal for long-tail targets
- PrevalenceAdjustedCP: group-prevalence adjusted split conformal
- MonteCarloConformal: MC-sample conformal with uncertainty-normalized scores

Composable features (all predictors):
- Normalized scores (difficulty-adaptive intervals)
- Mondrian groups (group-conditional calibration)
- Weighted scores (covariate-shift robustness)

class NonExchangeableConformalRegressor:
    """Weighted nonexchangeable (NexCP) split conformal regression intervals.

    Implements weighted split conformal prediction beyond exchangeability
    (Barber, Candès, Ramdas & Tibshirani, AoS 2023, arXiv:2202.13415):
    a weighted finite-sample quantile of nonconformity scores with importance
    weights ``w(x) = p_target(x) / p_source(x)`` pointing toward the test
    distribution.

    Coverage statement transcribed from the paper.  Let ``R(z)`` denote the
    residual vector of the (frozen) model on the full data sequence
    ``Z = (Z_1, ..., Z_{n+1})``, let ``R(Z^i)`` be the same after swapping
    data points ``i`` and ``n+1``, and let
    ``w~_i = w(X_i) / (sum_j w(X_j) + w(X_{n+1}))``.  Then:

    * Theorem 2 (lower bound):
      ``P{Y_{n+1} in C(X_{n+1})} >= 1 - alpha - sum_i w~_i * d_TV(R(Z), R(Z^i))``.
    * Theorem 3 (upper bound, split-conformal special case stated there):
      ``P{Y_{n+1} in C(X_{n+1})} < 1 - alpha + w~_{n+1} + sum_i w~_i * d_TV(R(Z), R(Z^i))``.

    Notation mapping to this class: ``scores_cal[i] = R(Z)_i``;
    ``self.weights_normalized_[i] = w(X_i) / sum_j w(X_j)`` (calibration-only
    normalization; the paper's ``w~_i`` additionally divides by
    ``1 + sum_j w(X_j)``, which only shrinks the stored ratios);
    ``self.max_weight_ratio_ = max_i w(X_i)/sum_j w(X_j)`` bounds the unknown
    test-point mass ``w~_{n+1}``.

    The swap TV terms ``d_TV(R(Z), R(Z^i))`` are not observable at calibration
    time, so :meth:`two_sided_coverage_bounds` reports the conservative
    computable instantiation used throughout this package: under fixed model +
    weights independent of the scores (assumptions A1/A2 of the MTTA protocol),
    each swap-TV term is bounded by twice the total-variation distance between
    the weighted and uniform empirical score distributions, which Gibbs--Su
    bounds by ``Delta = 0.5 * sum_i |w_i / sum_j w_j - 1/n|`` (stored as
    ``self.weight_tv_gap_``).  Substituting (and ``sum_i w~_i <= 1``) yields
    ``[1 - alpha - 2 * Delta, 1 - alpha + 2 * Delta + max_i w_i/sum_j w_j]``.
    Uniform weights give ``Delta = 0``: the bounds collapse to the ordinary
    finite-sample split-conformal statement.

    The threshold itself is the Tibshirani et al. (2019) weighted quantile of
    the augmented distribution with the test-point atom at ``+inf``: the
    weights are normalised (to mean one) before the quantile is taken, so it
    is invariant to rescaling ``w_cal``, and the test-point weight defaults
    to the mean calibration weight.  Pass the test point's own weight (on
    the raw ``w_cal`` scale) through ``test_weights`` of
    :meth:`interval_from_model` / :meth:`thresholds` for per-point
    thresholds.  When the calibration mass never reaches ``1 - alpha`` (too
    few or too unequal weights for the requested ``alpha``) the threshold is
    ``+inf`` and the interval is the whole real line, as the finite-sample
    guarantee requires.

    Args:
        alpha: Miscoverage level in (0, 1).
        normalize_weights: If ``True`` (default), the stored weight
            diagnostics (``weights_normalized_``, ``max_weight_ratio_``,
            ``weight_tv_gap_``) and the coverage bounds use ``w_cal``
            normalised to sum to one; if ``False`` they use the raw weights.
            The threshold is scale invariant and unaffected by this flag.

    """Weighted conformal regions for multi-target regression via a scalar score.

    Conformalizes a scalar multivariate nonconformity score of a predictive
    Gaussian ``(mu, Sigma)``: the Mahalanobis distance
    ``(y - mu)^T Sigma^{-1} (y - mu)`` (default) or the Gaussian negative log
    likelihood (``score_fn="nll"``, which adds the constant log-determinant
    terms).  Because the score is scalar, the resulting prediction region is a
    joint ellipsoid ``{y : s(mu, Sigma, y) <= r}`` whose radius carries a
    joint-marginal coverage guarantee: under (weighted) exchangeability,
    ``P(s(mu, Sigma, Y_new) <= r) >= 1 - alpha`` (weighted/NexCP semantics
    when importance weights are supplied, per Barber et al. 2023,
    arXiv:2202.13415).  Per-target conditional coverage is an empirical
    diagnostic only and is deliberately NOT claimed as a guarantee.

    Covariances may be full per-point ``[n, d, d]``, a single shared
    ``[d, d]`` matrix, or diagonal ``[n, d]`` / ``[d]``.

    Combines a training loss with a conformal predictor.  Supports two

        debias: Accepted for backward compatibility; no extra correction is
