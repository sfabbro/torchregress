"""
Base loss functions and abstract classes for regression tasks.

This module provides the foundation classes for all loss functions
in the torchregress library. Each base class handles specific aspects
of regression losses:

- BaseLoss: Root base class defining common interfaces
- RegressionLoss: Standard regression loss functions
- DistributionLoss: Losses for probabilistic/distributional regression

All losses follow PyTorch conventions with forward methods expecting
inputs in the form of (y_pred, target, ...).
