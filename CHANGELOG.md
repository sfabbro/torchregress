## [Unreleased]

**Algorithm freeze for 0.3.0 (from 2026-10-05):** no new methods or method changes
until 0.3.0 ships, except the competitive-gap items decided on 2026-10-07
(`TabularMLP`, model-agnostic UQ wrappers, calibrated-ensemble recipe, and
the flow, DML and transport improvements below). Other methods to add or
remove are decided for 0.4.0.

### Added
- `inference.random_fourier_features` and `inference.median_heuristic_bandwidth`: random Fourier feature nuisance basis for `orthogonal_partially_linear` with a median-heuristic bandwidth (median pairwise distance of the standardised `z` on a seeded subsample), per-covariate polynomial terms (`polynomial_degree`, default 1) and a seeded draw. `orthogonal_partially_linear(ridge="gcv" | "loo")` picks the nuisance ridge penalty per nuisance and training fold by generalized cross-validation or exact leave-one-out error (closed form from one SVD, unpenalised intercept); a float `ridge` (default `1e-6`) behaves exactly as before. Over 200 replications at n = 500 the old harness recipe (unit-bandwidth RFF, `ridge=1e-2`, no linear part) gave Coverage95 0.785 / bias +0.008 on CCDDHNR-2018 and 0.820 / +0.060 on the cubic design; the new defaults give 0.955 / +0.004 and 0.900 / +0.016, and `polynomial_degree=3` gives 0.945 / -0.002 on the cubic design (plan item B5).
- `losses.create_flow_model(bound=...)` sets the NSF spline tail bound (zuko fixes it at 5), and `losses.recommended_tail_bound(y_standardised)` derives it from the training target (data range with 25% head-room, clipped to [5, 25]). `NormalizingFlowLoss`'s out-of-range warning reports the actual bound. New "Training recipe for NLL and calibration" section in `docs/losses/nflows.md` (validation early stopping, derived bound, 16 bins): test NLL 1.272 -> 1.201 (skewed), 1.935 -> 1.852 (Student-t 3 df), 6.144 -> 5.417 (`load_diabetes`) with equal or better 90% interval scores, versus the fixed 60-epoch recipe of the harness `pzflow_parity` row (plan item B4). Library defaults (`bins=8`, bound 5) are unchanged.
- `test_time.select_high_confidence(scores=...)`: optional per-row ranking score (default: maximum probability).
- `torchregress.models`: `TabularMLP` (periodic numeric embeddings, SiLU blocks, dropout), `TabularPreprocessor` (median/IQR scaling, smooth clipping, NaN imputation with missing indicators), `fit_tabular` / `fit_tabular_ensemble` (AdamW, one-cycle schedule, early stopping with restore-best-weights, target standardisation) and `TabularFit`. Works with any loss, including `GaussianNLLLoss` (`2 * D` outputs) and `MultiQuantileLoss`. Docs: `docs/methods/tabular_mlp.md`, `docs/api/models.md`. `models` is a new lazy top-level submodule (plan item B2).

### Changed
- 28 plumbing helpers are no longer re-exported from `torchregress.utils` (and
  dropped from its `__all__`); they remain importable from their submodules, for
  example `from torchregress.utils.tensor_ops import convert_to_tensor`.
  `distributions`: `normal_cdf`. `gaussian_output`: `parse_heteroscedastic_output`,
  `low_rank_output_dim`, `split_low_rank_gaussian_output`. `numpy_stats`:
  `subsample_rows`, `winsorize`. `ordinal`: `labels_to_levels`,
  `normalize_class_probs`, `class_probs_to_levels`. `pytorch_compat`: `get_device`.
  `quantile`: `quantile_loss`, `multi_quantile_loss`. `tensor_ops`: `apply_mask`,
  `convert_to_tensor`, `ensure_batch_dim`, `prepare_cross_covariance`,
  `prepare_model_input_for_gradients`, `compute_model_gradients`,
  `calculate_gaussian_nll`, `calculate_propagated_variance`. `validation`:
  `validate_reduction`, `validate_range`, `validate_quantile`, `validate_weights`,
  `validate_metric_inputs`, `validate_sample_weight`, `check_tensor`. `security`:
  `validate_url`. `parse_heteroscedastic_output`, `low_rank_output_dim` and
  `split_low_rank_gaussian_output` stay public in `torchregress.ensemble` /
  `torchregress.losses`.
- Dependency floors raised to the newest releases resolvable from conda-forge:
  `torch>=2.13`, `numpy>=2.5`, `scipy>=1.18`, `torchmetrics>=1.9`; extras
  `matplotlib>=3.11`, `zuko>=1.6`, `scikit-learn>=1.9`, `pandas>=3.0`,
  `polars>=1.43`, `pyarrow>=25.0`, `pytest>=9.1`. Pre-commit hooks: ruff
  v0.16.10, pre-commit-hooks v6.0.0. Tested on torch 2.14.1 / numpy 2.5.3 /
  scipy 1.18.1 (PyPI) and the pixi lock (conda-forge torch 2.13.0).

### Fixed
- `test_time.ShiftFactoredPredictiveTransport`: the confident-row selection (`top_fraction`, default 0.5) now ranks rows on the unrenormalised in-grid peak probability (maximum bin probability times the predictive mass inside the support grid) instead of the renormalised maximum. Renormalisation inflated the peak of predictives cut by the grid edge, so on fine grids the selection favoured them and the EM prior mean overshot a label shift by up to 0.32 |shift| at 256 bins (0.14 at 64); it is now below 0.07 |shift| at 16, 64 and 256 bins for shifts of +/-0.8. Selected rows, and therefore `target_prior` and the adapted predictive, change for a given input (plan item B6).
- `inference.orthogonal_partially_linear`: both nuisance regressions (`E[x|z]`, `E[y|z]`) now share one cross-fitting split. Independent splits biased `theta` (-0.026, about 7.7 standard errors, over 200 replications of the DoubleML CCDDHNR-2018 design at n = 500); found by the harness `orthogonal_inference` suite against DoubleML on the same nuisance basis. Point estimates for a given `seed` change.
- **0.3.0 release audit: 61 defects fixed**, each with a regression test in
  `tests/audit/` (full list with severities: `docs/reports/audit_0.3.0.md`).
  Results that change for existing code:
  - *Conformal prediction.* Thresholds are `+inf` (infinite intervals) when
    `ceil((n+1)(1-alpha)) > n`, per Mondrian group, or when the weighted mass
    cannot reach `1-alpha`; they used to fall back to the largest score and
    under-cover at small `n`. Weighted conformal follows Tibshirani et al.
    (2019): only relative weights matter, the test point defaults to the mean
    calibration weight, and a new `test_weights=` argument gives per-point
    thresholds. CV+/Jackknife+ use the lower rank `floor(alpha (n+1))`.
    `DensityConformal` scores use the density at `y_pred` in both phases.
    Negative Mondrian group ids work; R2C, CTI, DCP and `SLSConformal` honour
    `groups=`. `SemiConformalCalibrator` computes in float64.
  - *Losses.* `EvidentialRegressionLoss` uses the NIG predictive
    (`Omega = 2 beta (1 + nu)`, Amini et al. 2020, Eq. 8). Skew-t NLL values
    change (incomplete-beta bug). Skew-normal, censored/AFT, zero-inflated
    Poisson and GEV are exact in the tails instead of saturating.
    `BetaNLLLoss` and `CVaRLoss` handle 1-D `[B]` inputs. Weighted `'mean'`
    is normalised by the sum of weights in the flow, multi-expectile and
    imbalanced losses (FocalR, BalancedMSE, BinReweightedMSE,
    DensityWeighted, LDS, PropensityWeighted), and `BaseLoss` accepts `[B, D]`
    masks with `[B]` weights. `ExpectileCrossoverLoss` raises on
    non-ascending levels. EIV losses propagate gradients through the
    Jacobian; latent-marginalisation and input-noise losses now marginalise;
    `SLSLoss.forward` no longer mutates state (new `evaluate_frontier`).
  - *Metrics.* `distribution_metrics_report["crps"]` is exact (was 3-4% low).
    Quantile PIT randomises out-of-range targets (seedable `generator=`).
    MedAE/MAD/NMAD use the true median and per-output averaging (sklearn);
    trimmed MSE matches `scipy.stats.trim_mean`. `VarioScore.higher_is_better`
    is `True`. Absolute variance floors and covariance jitter became
    `min_variance=` / relative `jitter=` arguments.
  - *Calibration.* `VarianceTemperatureScaler` has no hidden `[0.05, 20]`
    clamp (`temperature_bounds=` restores it) and returns the closed-form MLE
    by default. `IsotonicMeanCalibrator` is true isotonic regression.
  - *Inference and causal.* `ppi_quantile_ci` inverts the rectified CDF
    (Angelopoulos et al. 2023); the old estimator was inconsistent. PPI and
    DR estimators keep float64; the PPI bootstrap no longer allocates an
    `[n_boot, N]` matrix. DR `fold_bootstrap` standard errors are correct
    (were 0.56x at two folds); trimming every unit raises.
  - *Ensembles.* Predicted variances use the `GaussianNLLLoss` training range
    `[1e-6, e^30]` (was `[e^-8, e^6]`); `predict` runs in eval mode and
    restores the previous modes; `base_seed` leaves the global RNG alone.
    `bars_to_density_grid` puts no mass outside the bin edges.
  - *Semi-supervised.* The documented trust-weight options (`tau`,
    `weight_power`, `hard_weight_threshold`, `batch_relative_mode`,
    `batch_trust_top_k`) take effect; `TeacherStudentTrainer(tau=)` defaults
    to 0.2, the value the code always used. Unknown options raise.
- `test_time.ShiftFactoredPredictiveTransport.ppi_target_ci` keeps float64 inputs.
- **Audit batches 4–5** (`algorithms`, `test_time`, `utils`, `prediction`,
  `comparison`, `viz`): 37 more defects fixed (one documented, decision
  pending), tests in `tests/audit/test_audit_batch4.py`
  and `test_audit_batch5.py`.
  - *IRLS* weights are `w(r/sigma)` times the initial precision; they used to
    compound over iterations (`w^n_iter`). `variance_type="robust"` takes the
    MAD over samples (it was zero for `(N, 1)` targets). Concatenated
    `[mean, log_sigma]` outputs work with the default config.
  - *SIMEX* accepts float64, is scale-equivariant (no absolute jitter), and
    `predict` averages independent remeasurements. *Regression calibration*
    honours `posterior(sigma_u=)` and uses relative eigenvalue floors.
  - *Weighted / OT conformal and transport conformal* return infinite
    intervals when the finite-sample guarantee needs them, and the transport
    threshold is the exact order statistic (it was one too high).
  - `DomainClassifierRatioEstimator` corrects for unequal pool sizes;
    `DelayedLabelResidualAdapter` no longer deflates the first batch;
    `IVON.state_dict()` stores the step count; `HeteroscedasticLaplaceRegressor`
    accepts a plain linear head and `n_samples=1`; `BayesianLinearHead`
    honours `generator=`; transport, label-shift and pseudo-label helpers keep
    float64.
  - `comparison.compute_point_metrics` no longer broadcasts `[N, 1]` against
    `[N]` (N×N errors) and averages R² per output (scikit-learn).
  - `masked_mean`/`masked_sum` ignore NaN at masked positions; Box-Cox and
    Yeo-Johnson are accurate for small lambda; `normal_cdf` is accurate in the
    lower tail; validators reject NaN; `quantiles_to_density_grid` sorts
    crossing quantiles (its truncation to `[q_0, q_K]` is now documented);
    numeric-coded nominal OpenML columns load.
  - Viz: residual histogram and QQ plot handle `[N, 1]` predictions, the PIT
    histogram spans [0, 1], the Qini area is finite, RMSCE ignores empty bins,
    `plot_performance_comparison` knows more lower-is-better metrics, and
    plots that create their own figure close it.
- Found by the harness after the audit (tests in
  `tests/audit/test_audit_postharness.py`):
  - `SkewTLoss` / `skew_t_nll`: the gradient with respect to the skewness was
    exactly zero at `alpha = 0`, so heads initialised there never learned
    skew. The Student-t CDF term is now smooth at 0 and log-space in the
    tails; values are unchanged (match scipy).
  - `ShiftFactoredPredictiveTransport`: the source prior is the mean source
    predictive distribution on the support grid (it was an eps-clamped label
    histogram), and support-grid EM stops on a log-likelihood plateau. EM no
    longer collapses onto empty margin bins (prior TV ~1 with no shift) and
    prior transport is applied under label shift. `estimate_target_prior_em`
    gives classes with no source mass a target prior of 0; new
    `LabelShiftEMConfig.loglik_tol` (default off).
  - Docs: EM label-shift estimation needs calibrated source posteriors (BBSE
    does not).
- Metrics return float64 for float64 inputs (18 metrics used to return
  float32), and functional metric wrappers move their internal torchmetrics
  state to the input device. Calibration-error histograms no longer use
  `torch.histogram`, which has no CUDA kernel.
- `import torchregress.test_time` works without scikit-learn (only the default
  classifier of `WeightedConformalRegressionAdapter` needs it).
- Examples: every script runs against the current API; external comparisons
  use MAPIE 1.x, torchcp 1.2 and scikit-learn's `TweedieRegressor`; the
  Tweedie examples no longer apply `exp` twice.
- `CORALLoss` no longer overwrites the `CumulativeLinkLoss` docstring: it is
  now a thin subclass of `CumulativeLinkLoss` with its own docstring (same
  computation, same `"coral"` registry key).
- `torchregress.method_catalog` declares an explicit `__all__` (its 4
  dataclasses, `CapabilityValue` and 5 functions), so `import *` no longer
  re-exports `Any`, `Dict`, `dataclass` and the other typing imports.
- Docs: removed names that do not exist (`PackedEnsembleRegressor`,
  `MCDropoutModel`, `BayesianModelAveraging`, `mse`, `mean_absolute_percentage_error`,
  `conformal_loss`, `create_eiv_loss`, ...) and corrected calls the functions
  do not accept (`mask=`/`weights=` on point metrics, which take `sample_weight`;
  `AsymmetricLeastSquaresLoss(tau=)`, `create_grid_figure(n_cols=)`,
  `plot_pit_histogram(bins=)`, `prediction_interval_coverage(confidence=)`).
  `plot_target_density_error_overlap` is now shown as `(y_true, y_pred)`.
- `highest_posterior_density_coverage`: the docstring and the metrics guide now
  state that `alpha` is the nominal HPD mass, not the miscoverage (no
  behaviour change).

### Packaging and CI
- SPDX licence metadata (`setuptools>=77`), project URLs, typed classifier;
  the sdist ships the test suite and CHANGELOG.
- CI `package` job and release `install-smoke` matrix (Linux/macOS, Python
  3.12–3.14): build, check contents (`scripts/release/check_dist.py`),
  `twine check --strict`, install with core dependencies only and import every
  submodule (`scripts/release/smoke_install.py`).
- `docs.yml` publishes the documentation to GitHub Pages.
- Local CUDA testing: `cuda` marker, CPU-vs-device parity suite for 77 losses
  and 94 metrics (`tests/test_device_parity.py`), `pixi run test-cuda`
  writing `reports/cuda/<date>_<sha>.txt`.

### Tests
- `tests/metrics/test_reference_parity.py` checks all 97 `metrics` exports
  against scoringrules, properscoring, scipy, scikit-learn or closed forms
  (14 have no reference and say why); `tests/metrics/test_scoring_properties.py`
  adds Hypothesis invariants (CRPS non-negativity and equivariance,
  propriety, pinball monotonicity). `scoringrules`, `properscoring` and
  `hypothesis` join the `test` extra.

### Added
- `losses.FaithfulGaussianLoss`: `mean_weight` accepts a per-output vector (length `D`, validated finite and non-negative), and a new `mean_loss="huber"` option (with `huber_delta`) bounds the pull of outlying targets on the mean. Defaults unchanged. `mean_weight` is now a registered buffer.
- `utils.BSplineDensityBasis`: unit-integral (M-spline) B-spline basis for simplex-parameterised 1D densities — exact bin integrals, cumulative moments and `E|U - x|` via piecewise Gauss–Legendre.
- `losses.DiscreteWasserstein1Loss` / `discrete_wasserstein1`: 1-Wasserstein between mass vectors on a shared 1D grid (mass or point targets).
- `losses.RankNContrastLoss` / `rank_n_contrast_loss`: Rank-N-Contrast (Zha et al. 2023) with tie-aware rank denominators, mask/weights support.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed
- `BetaNLLLoss` preserves `[B,D]` elementwise before `_reduce` so partial masks `[[True,False]]` no longer discard whole rows (NEW-HIGH-02)
- `PoissonLikelihoodRatioLoss` clamps `exp(y_pred.clamp(max=30))` to avoid `inf` for `y_pred~100` (NEW-HIGH-04)
- `GEV` `gev_nll_elementwise` masks `1/xi` and `pow(-1/xi)` via `use_gev` so `xi→0` does not overflow before `where` (NEW-HIGH-03)
- `Tweedie p=1` Poisson term uses `ratio.clamp(min=eps)` not `log(+eps)` bias (NEW-MED-03)
- `prediction.quantiles_to_density_grid` forces `float32` levels for int quantiles, `n_support>=2` and `isfinite` guards (NEW-LOW-01/05)
- `losses/families.py` adds `unconstrained_inputs` flag (default `True`) to avoid `softplus(softplus(x))` (NEW-MED-01, pattern shown for SkewNormal/SkewT)
- `losses/conformal.py` unifies `_weighted_conformal_threshold` → `_weighted_quantile` augmented `+w_{n+1}=1` (NEW-HIGH-01) and CV+/Jackknife+ docs correct `>=1-2alpha` (NEW-HIGH-05)
- `ensemble/swag.py` skips BatchNorm `running_*` buffers in posterior (NEW-HIGH-06)
- `algorithms/simex.py` validates `sigma_u` PSD via cholesky, warns if `|w|>5` (NEW-HIGH-07)
- `algorithms/tictac.py` clamps `log_k` to `[-6,6]` and warns if Hessian `>50M` elems (~200MB) (NEW-HIGH-08)
- `algorithms/adaptive_prior_vi.py` `VIDSRegressor` KL and NLL both `mean()` so KL not dominated by `P` (NEW-HIGH-09)
- `losses/__init__.py` adds explicit `__all__` (139 symbols) for `audit_api_coverage.py` soundness (TR-API-01 latent)

### Changed
- `BetaNLLLoss` numerics: previously `sum(dim=-1)` then `mean` over `B`; now `mean` over `B*D` elementwise (breaking for `D>1`, semver MINOR, documented)
- `README` badge `python 3.12 | 3.13 | 3.14 | 3.15` now matches `pyproject.toml:14 requires-python <3.16` (NEW-LOW-09)

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog) and release-script `prepare_release.sh` now enforces bump
