"""Regression tests for the patches documented in the deep-loss review.

Each test class targets one BLOCKER / HIGH bug identified during the loss
review and pins down the post-patch behavior so the pre-patch regressions
cannot silently resurface.

Contract: each TestCase below is annotated with the pre-fix failure mode
that the corresponding test catches.  Tests in classes marked
``(DETECTS_PRE_FIX)`` will FAIL on pre-fix code; tests in classes
marked ``(HIGH-LEVEL SANITY)`` verify forward-looking invariants and may
not detect pre-fix in modern PyTorch (documented inline).

Affected fixes:
* B1 (``sls.py``): :class:`SLSLoss.forward` step_counter is no longer
  decremented at the end of ``forward``, so the curriculum actually advances.
* H1 (``base.py``): :class:`WeightedLossWrapper` no longer silently drops a
  non-default ``reduction`` already configured on a wrapped loss instance.
* H2 (``mdn.py``): :class:`MixtureDensityLoss` with
  ``covariance_type='full'`` builds its Cholesky factor without an
  in-place write on a tensor that carries gradient from ``y_pred``. The
  bug surface is reliably discriminated by the ``L_matrices._version``
  capture in
  ``TestMixtureDensityLossFullCovBackward::test_full_covariance_L_version_zero``,
  even under modern PyTorch's silent absorption of in-place writes.
* H3 (``conformal.py``): :class:`LocalConformal` and
  :class:`LocalConformalMAD` ``predict_interval`` append a sentinel True
  column to the cumulative-weight hit mask so ``argmax`` cannot silently
  return ``0`` when no entry satisfies ``cum_weights >= q_level``. See
  docstring on the H3 class for the detection caveat (modern PyTorch's
  ``torch.cumsum`` is non-trivial to monkeypatch from pytest).
* H4 (``conformal.py``): :class:`CQR.debias` docstring/code alignment and
  ``n<=0`` calibration set guard.

How we verified the test/pass-on-post-fix-on-pre-fixcontract
------------------------------------------------------------
We ran a revert/restore cycle per fix.  The four bugs that surface in
modern PyTorch:

* **B1** — all three SLS tests fail on the reverted (pre-fix) ``sls.py``.
  Counter stays pinned at 0; the K=2 union-frontier unfreeze branch
  never fires.
* **H1** — three of five WLW tests fail on the reverted ``base.py``
  (the bug only manifests for the *instance* path with a non-default
  reduction).  The two class-path tests are smoke tests.
* **H4** — four of six CQR debias tests fail on the reverted
  ``conformal.py`` (the direct ``(n+1)/n`` division raises
  ZeroDivisionError on empty calibration; the alpha factor mismatch
  surfaces in `test_debias_factor_shrinks_alpha` and
  `test_debias_alpha_is_restored`).
* **H2** — verified via ``L_matrices._version`` capture at forward-return
  time (recipe steps 1-3 of the original recipe).  Pre-fix builds
  ``L_matrices`` via two in-place ``__setitem__`` writes on
  ``L_offdiag`` (``_version >= 2``); post-fix composes it via
  ``torch.where`` (``_version == 0``).  See
  ``tests/losses/test_loss_fixes.py::TestMixtureDensityLossFullCovBackward::test_full_covariance_L_version_zero``.
* **H3** — modern PyTorch 2.x handles the pre-fix code paths gracefully, so
  the bare "raise / return inf" tests cannot reliably distinguish
  pre-fix from post-fix from a test.
